        <header><h3>What is Rice with Pork?</h3></header>
        <p>
          The story of Rice with pork came from Cơm Tấm or Com Tam (US: /kʌm
          təm/; Vietnamese: [kəːm tə̌m]) is a Vietnamese dish made from rice with
          fractured rice grains. Tấm refers to the broken rice grains, while cơm
          refers to cooked rice.[1][2] Although there are varied names like cơm
          tấm Sài Gòn (Saigon-style broken rice), particularly for Saigon,[1]
          the main ingredients remain the same for most cases.

          In its early days, Com Tam was a popular dish among poor rice farmers
          in the Mekong Delta due to their economic circumstances.[3] During bad
          rice seasons, these people didn't have enough good rice to sell, so
          they used broken rice to cook. Broken rice is fragments of rice grains
          broken during the handling processes and was regarded as inferior rice
          at the time.[4] Broken rice was used solely because it was readily
          available in the farmers' houses and could fill their stomachs for a
          long time.[3]

          Since Vietnam's urbanization in the first half of the 20th century,
          Com Tam became popular across Southern provinces, including
          Saigon.[5][4][6] When Saigon was bustling with many people from many
          countries around the world, food sellers adapted Com Tam to be more
          suitable for foreign customers like the French, American, Chinese, and
          Indian. As a result, grilled pork, chả trứng (Vietnamese-style steamed
          omelet with pork) was added to Com Tam. Also, the portion started
          being served on plates with a fork instead of in traditional bowls
          with chopsticks.[3][7] Nowadays, Com Tam is popular among everyone,
          and is a "standardized part of the [Saigon] culture",[5][6] so much
          that there is a common metaphorical saying (translated from
          Vietnamese): "Saigon people eat Com Tam like Ha Noi people eat
          Pho".[8][9][10]
